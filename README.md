StatsCore [![Travis build: unknown](https://travis-ci.org/LegendOfMCPE/StatsCore.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/LegendOfMCPE/StatsCore)
=========
A PocketMine-MP new API plugin + utils library of LegendOfMCPE plugins


Note: this plugin uses the Google Timezone API, which provides data with daylight saving time, but if the player is registered when he is in daylight saving time, his IP will be assumed as in daylight saving time forever unless the data is removed from from the database, which will cause a recalculation of his timezone.
